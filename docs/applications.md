### Coverage Results

The detailed coverage results for APE and manual analysis are provided as an [Excel sheet](../assets/data/CoverageResults.xlsx). 
For each application under study, we mark which activities are reached by APE and which are reached manually.


### App Analysis

The detailed breakdown of reasons for unreachability of manually analyzed apps is also provided as an [Excel sheet](../assets/data/AppAnalysis.xlsx). 
For each application under study, we grey out activities that are reached manually, and for each unreached activity, we mark the reasons leading to unreachability as described in the paper, i.e., Device (Software properties and Hardware properties), Server, Environment, External resources (Equipment and Information), Usage patterns, Alternate entry, Disabled (For app version and For all end-users), Error handling and Unknown.
